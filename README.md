# betterCombine
combine geometry in Maya without destroying hierarchies

usage:

Select the SHAPE nodes you wish to combine (not the objects - tip: Choose the objects and then tap down arrow) then just run the script.  It will create a new mesh node that combines your shapes into one, leaving your original shapes untouched.  Good for making ncollision objects and that sort of thing.
